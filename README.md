# Super Mario Brick Game (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple brick breaker game inspired by the classic Super Mario Bros. aesthetic, built using only HTML and CSS.

## How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  The game will start automatically.
3.  Unfortunately, **this version is purely visual and non-interactive.** The bricks will not break, and there is no paddle or ball. It's a static representation of a brick breaker game with a Super Mario theme.

## What you'll see

* A game screen layout resembling a brick breaker game.
* Bricks arranged in a pattern, visually styled with elements from the Super Mario universe (e.g., colors, possibly simple shapes).
* A designated area for a paddle (though it won't move).
* A visual representation of a ball (though it won't bounce).

## Technologies Used

* HTML: For structuring the game elements.
* CSS: For styling the visual appearance of the game, including colors, layout, and potentially simple animations (if any).

## Limitations

* **No interactivity:** This version is purely for visual presentation. You cannot control a paddle or break bricks.
* **Basic visuals:** The styling is done with pure CSS, so complex graphics or animations are limited.

## Future Enhancements (Requires JavaScript)

To make this game playable, the following would need to be implemented using JavaScript:

* Paddle control (moving left and right).
* Ball movement and collision detection (with walls, paddle, and bricks).
* Brick breaking logic.
* Scoring system.
* Game over conditions.

## Credits

* Inspired by the classic Super Mario Bros. game.
* Built with HTML and CSS.
